Then there was GitHub
---------------------

- Github is git, but git is not github
- Github is to git as Facebook is to jpegs
- Track code, issues, documentation related to open source software projects.
- If you want to code, hanging out on Github is a very good idea! 
- If you want to work with us exasperating geeks, it can't hurt to know how our haunts work, if only to report a bug or suggest an improvement.
